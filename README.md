# bip39-playground
## Introduction

I started this project to reproduce https://www.ledger.com/blog/funds-of-every-wallet-created-with-the-trust-wallet-browser-extension-could-have-been-stolen and to learn Rust and opencl.
Initially it was based on https://github.com/johncantrell97/bip39-solver-gpu but I reorganized it to make it a bit more modular and extended the scope of the project.

## Tools included
* <strong>producer-cl</strong> is command line generator of wallet addresses based on bip39 12 words passphrases. Currently the passphrase are generated using opencl from Mersenne Twister randoms based on all the possible 32 bits seeds. The addresses are stored in flat files named from the address formats. This tool is able to generate the following address formats:
    - BTC BIP44
    - BTC BIP49
    - ETH
    - LTC
    - XRP
    - ZEC
    - DOGE
    - TRX

* <strong>filter</strong> is a command line tool taking as input one of the address files generated by the producer and matching it agains a list of known addresses.
-- The matching addresses are simply printed on the standard output.

* <strong>scraper</strong> is a command line tool checking the current balance of addresses by scraping online blockchain explorers or equivant tools.
